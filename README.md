### nick_scripts
This is a repository to house simple, but useful scripts I've created for myself or friends.   
(mostly WWU related productivity hacks)



#### SSH_dispatch.sh
A script that will broadcast a Bash command to every machine on the CS department network at Western Washington University. Forced to use Chromium because you forgot to close Firefox at some point in your undergraduate career? Well not anymore! 
Load this badboy up and run __$nk_dispatch "pkill firefox"__  
###### install
